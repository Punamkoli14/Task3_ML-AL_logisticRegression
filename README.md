# Task3_ML-AL_logisticRegression
 I have completed my 4rd task of AI & ML INTERNSHIP of Elevate Lab.In this project worked on a real-world dataset of Breast Cancer .Project focused on detecting breast cancer using the Logistic Regression algorithm. This model was trained on the well-known Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which includes features derived from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies: 1)Python 2)Pandas, NumPy 3)Matplotlib 4)Scikit-learn

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights:

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding feature distribution and correlation.

ðŸ§¹ Data cleaning and preprocessing, including scaling and label encoding.

ðŸ¤– Implementation of Logistic Regression for binary classification (Benign vs. Malignant).

âœ… Achieved high accuracy and evaluated model performance using metrics like confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.
